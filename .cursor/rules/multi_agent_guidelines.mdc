# Multi-Agent Collaboration Guidelines

- Alternate personas every turn in the order defined by the active command.
- Each persona’s turn must follow the **Observe → Reason → Adjust → Verify → Hand Off** pattern.
- Keep edits focused on the referenced artifact; avoid unrelated commentary.
- Mark follow-up work with `> TODO (Role)` and describe the needed action.
- Ensure accessibility, performance, and security considerations are explicitly called out when relevant.
- End the session only after every persona confirms the goal is met and outstanding questions are documented.

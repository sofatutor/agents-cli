# Phase 2: Advanced Multi-Agent Workflows
**Duration: TBD** | **Goal**: Production-Ready Multi-Agent Orchestration

> **Status**: Planning phase
> **Depends on**: [Phase 1](phase1.md) completion
> **Previous Phase**: [Phase 1: Core Development Foundation](phase1.md)

## 🎯 Phase 2 Objectives

- **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Agent handoffs and orchestration patterns
- **Advanced Orchestration**: Parallel execution, conditional routing, loops
- **Workflow Engine**: Comprehensive workflow state management
- **Production Features**: Scalability, monitoring, and optimization
- **Advanced Tool Integration**: Complex tool patterns and custom frameworks
- **IDE Enhancements**: Advanced IDE integration features

## 📋 Major Components

### 🔄 **1. Multi-Agent Workflow Engine**
- Advanced `WorkflowEngine` with multiple execution patterns
- Agent handoff chains and conditional routing
- Parallel agent execution and coordination
- Workflow state tracking and persistence
- Dynamic workflow generation and modification

### 🏗️ **2. Advanced Agent Management**
- Comprehensive agent lifecycle management
- Agent registry with pools and resource management
- Agent health monitoring and automatic recovery
- Load balancing and dynamic scaling
- Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)

### 🔧 **3. Production Tool Framework**
- Advanced tool orchestration and dependency management
- Custom tool development framework and SDK
